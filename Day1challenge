Day1-Challenge
Prompt: Sign Up
Create a sign up page, modal, form, or app screen related to signing up for something. 
It could be for a volunteer event, contest registration, a giveaway, or anything you can image.


This code creates a basic signup page with a modal form for contest registration. 
When the "Register Now" button is clicked, the modal form appears. Users can fill in their details and submit the form, which will display an alert and close the modal.
